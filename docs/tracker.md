# Bill Sharing App
Split and Track the Easy Way

**Abstract**

The main aim of the team is to develop an Android application to split the bill, track bills and other shared expenses spent among the friends of group of people and make sure everyone is paid back the correct amount. Using this application we can create groups add friends to the grouped created. We can add and edit the expense in the group created to share the expense between the people, will let you know how much you owe and how much u get. Push notifications will be triggered once an expense is added to let us know the updates. We can add the bill image to the expense added to show the expense. 

**Tools Used to build the application**
* Android
* Spring Boot
* Image Retrofit
* Firebase Cloud Messaging
* Hibernate
* MySQL
* Android FindBugs
* Junit
* Espresso
* Jenkins
* Gradle

### Overall Learning:
1. Scrum meetings: The team had made it a point to meet at least twice a week for about 10-15 minutes, to work closely on to project.  
1. User stories are captured from an end-user perspective from the initial team discussion and the requirements are prioritized based on the team discussions.
3. Project documentation is maintained for project and the dashboard tracker is used to hand over the work and project update to next scrum master. The tasks performed and the roles of team members, achievements, things learnt and backlogs are maintained and mentioned in the tracker. 
4. XP programming practice like Pair Programming is implemented where people worked together towards a common goal.
5. Test driven development was implemented to ensure the quality of the code 
6. Continuous Integration was performed, to detect problems early so that updates can be shipped easily.
7. Refactoring code was performed to simplify the design in the code without changing its behavior.
8. Handling Product Backlogs: listing of things that are needed to be done within a particular sprint which are carried forward.
9. Release plan: Which focuses on the velocity at which the project was going and by observing how much work had been done per iteration.
